# Nails

Nails ain't Rails.   

If you want to write a web app, Nails is a terrible choice.
If you'd like to see a bit of the magic behind Ruby on Rails, Nails might be worth looking at.

## Installation

Although Nails is technically a gem, it is really meant as a learning tool and the best
way to learn from it is to clone the repo:
    git clone https://github.com/natejenkins/nails

Then cd into the repo and

    bundle install

You can run the example application:

    cd example
    rackup

Or you can play around in the console:

    rake console
